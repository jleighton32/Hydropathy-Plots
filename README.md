The goal of our project is to look for orthologous proteins in C. elegans. To do this we aligned a protein sequence of interest from H. sapiens to the M. musculus ortholog and the potential C. elegans ortholog. Once the alignment was created we wanted to look at the hydropathic properties of each protein and compare how alike the C. elegans protein is to the H. sapien protein. To compare we evaluated the Pearson coefficients for the C. elegans amino acid (aa) sequence against the H. sapien and M. musculus sequences, a beta distribution derived for each sequence. We used a comparison of the critical values to a P < 0.002 level of significance was made.
